## Description

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://dann-lam.github.io/04-06-2023-mod-05-chall/)

This is a site that features coloring of the current hour, it also saves text in the input field for storage.

This exercise utilizes the fundamentals on DayJS works, how DOM traversal works, local storage, and logic on handling objects utilizing all three, also some jQuery.
It's also a fantastic tool for scheduling what needs to be done, a color reminder of what is coming up, and what is due.

## Usage

Simply type your "ToDo" into the list, and click on the button. This will save your text into local storage. When you refresh, it should still be there!
Grey is past, red is current, and green is todos in the future.

## Learning Points

The hardest part was traversing the DOM, as some of the aspects of traversing it is slightly obscured, but was great for reading documentation. In the future, i'd like to practice utilizing Jquery some more.
For some reason, the DayJS timer pops up quite late upon spawning the page.
